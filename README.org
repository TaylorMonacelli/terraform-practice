* TODO Question: is there a way to make provisioning happen after IP/DNS setup

Use case: I want chef server to install in provisioning step, but during
the install, I'd like to ssh into machine and do other things, but
provisioning happens before DNS/IP is output so I don't know how to ssh
into machine.  Instead I have to wait for chef to fully install which
takes a while.

Is there a way to get IP before provisioning is started?
